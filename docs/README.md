# API Reference

The GoAPI is the best resource for our customers to gain access to our data. A customer can get access to our APIs by getting a key from the Dealer Portal. The files listed above are documented endpoints that can be used by our customers. We find most customers use the "Product Specific APIs" listed below.

## Get an API Key
Before you can use the GoAPI you need to have an API Key. Follow the steps below to get an API key.

1. Login to the [Dealer Site](https://dealers.curtmfg.com/)
   - If you don't know your password [Forgot Password](https://dealers.curtmfg.com/account/forgot)
   - If you need to create an account [Create Account](https://dealers.curtmfg.com/account/create)
2. Go to [Manage API Keys](https://dealers.curtmfg.com/account/keys)
3. You should have a "Public" Key with the brands "CURT", "ARIES", and "Luverne" under selected brands. If any of the brands are listed under missing, we suggest you press the '+' button and have all brands selected.
4. The "Public" key is the key you will when making an API call. (Don't worry about the private key, it's not used)
